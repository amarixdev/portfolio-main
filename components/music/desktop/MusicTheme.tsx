              A software developer based in North Carolina. I attended the
              University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill from 2015 to 2019,
              where I competed in track and field, was a pre-dental student, and
              medical researcher. I was grateful to receive an invitation to
              attend Dental School in 2021, but after long consideration and
              some time off during the pandemic I ultimately decided healthcare
              was not for me.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the career change, I have worked on a number of web
              applications for both myself and others. As a software developer,
              I get enjoyment out out of seeing my ideas manifest at every scale
              and take pride in devoting my full attention and energy to each
              project I undertake. Thank you for taking some time to learn more
              about me and I look forward to connecting.
